This bot will help you search for a movie or TV series. It works using the kinopoiskunofficial api. 
A Postgresql database is connected to it, which stores the user_id and user_name of the users who clicked the /start command. 
Also, for easier reading of user data, user_id and user_name are stored in an excel table
